# moledata

This repository contains data sets used in tutorials during the [Workshop on Molecular Evolution at MBL, Woods Hole](https://molevolworkshop.github.io).

These files were originally stored at [github.com/molevolworkshop/assets/data](https://github.com/molevolworkshop/assets/data) but the 1 GB limit on GitHub pages web sites made this unwieldy as some tutorials (e.g. phylogenomics) require large data sets.

Below is a list of the files contained here:
