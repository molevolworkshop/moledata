# moledata

This repository contains data sets used in tutorials during the [Workshop on Molecular Evolution at MBL, Woods Hole](https://molevolworkshop.github.io).

These files were originally stored at [github.com/molevolworkshop/assets/data](https://github.com/molevolworkshop/assets/data) but the 1 GB limit on GitHub pages web sites made this unwieldy as some tutorials (e.g. phylogenomics) require large data sets.

Below is a list of the files contained here:

## IQ-TREE lab

The divtime directory contains files used in the [Estimating a Time-Calibrated Phylogeny of Fossil and Extant Taxa using Morphological Data](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/fbd_simple/) tutorial (written Joëlle Barido-Sottani, Joshua Justison, April M. Wright, Rachel C. M. Warnock, Walker Pett, and Tracy A. Heath).
